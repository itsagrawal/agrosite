## Problem:
  Indian farmers face numerous challenges within the market system, According to the National Sample Survey, around 86% of farmers are small and marginal and the rest are large farmers. In the traditional market system, both small and large Indian farmers face distinct challenges. Small farmers, who constitute a significant portion of the farming community, struggle with limited market access, poor bargaining power and lack of infrastructure due to insufficient capital. According to the Agricultural Census of India 2015-16, small operational holdings (less than 2 hectares) accounted for about 86.2% of the total operational holdings. 
some common problems faced by farmers are:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited market access</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Lack of price transparency and fair pricing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Inefficient equipment utilization</strong></li>
  <li><strong>lack of infrastructure due to insufficient capital</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Limited access to market information and trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Dependency on intermediaries</strong></li>
</ul>
These challenges underscore the need for market reforms, that promote fair pricing mechanisms, strengthen market infrastructure, and enhance farmers' access to market information.
